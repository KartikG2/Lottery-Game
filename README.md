# Lottery-Game
My first mini project using React.js

<h2>The Lottery-Ticket</h2>

Note :
If the total sum of the number on the lottery ticket is equals to 15 then, you win the lottery!ðŸ¥³

You can generate as many tickets as you wish.


I learnt all the basic stuff of react like :
> Components
> JSX
> Props
> Virtual DOM
> Hooks
> states and so on
